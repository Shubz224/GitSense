## üß† How It Works

### 1. **Loading Repository Files**
   - GitSense uses **LangChain** to load repository files as documents.
   - Each document is processed and stored for further analysis.

### 2. **Generating Commit Summaries**
   - The **Google Gemini API** is used to generate concise summaries for each commit.
   - Summaries are displayed on the dashboard for easy reference.

### 3. **Creating Embeddings**
   - All documents are converted into embeddings using AI.
   - These embeddings are stored in the database for efficient retrieval.

### 4. **Answering User Questions**
   - When a user asks a question, it is converted into a vector.
   - A **cosine similarity query** is performed across all vectorized summaries.
   - The top 10 most relevant files are returned, along with an AI-generated summary of the answer.
